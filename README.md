📂 Project Description

This project is a simple Number Guessing Game.

The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.

The player has 5 chances to guess the number.

After each guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

If the player guesses correctly, the game ends.

If the player fails within 5 attempts, the correct number is revealed.

▶️ How to Run

Save the file as number_guessing_game.py.

Run the program in Python:

python number_guessing_game.py


Start guessing the number!

🏆 Goal

Practice:

Making decisions with if/else.

Using loops (for) for repeated attempts.

Generating random numbers with the random library.
